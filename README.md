# Network-Dismentling-Problem-NDP-
network science -> network dismantling problem

The study of the network dismantling problem in complex networks focuses on identifying an optimal subset of nodes whose removal leads to:
(1) efficient fragmentation of the network, breaking it into small, disconnected components that no longer form a large-scale connected structure; and
(2) disruption of spreading processes at the minimal possible cost.

🌟 Generalized network dismantling problem

🌟 Cost

Assumption1️⃣ that the cost of removing nodes is the same.
Assumption2️⃣ that the cost of removing nodes is different.

🌟 Properities
- Topology properities: node centrality
- Nontopology features:
- Spectral properties

🌟 Random attack and target attack

🌟 Network Modeling

🕸️ Scale-free NDP

🕸️ Erdos– R´enyi NDP

🌟 Approximations
